        <h3>Digital Designer, Yrgo, 2022-(2024)</h3>
        <p>
          During my studies at Yrgo, I got to develop my skills in several
          digital tools and the philosophy of design. Example of program we were
          taught are Figma, Blender and the Adobe programs photoshop and
          illustrator.

          Sustainability Enterprise Development, Jönköping University, 2020-2021
        </h3>
        <p>
          I studied for a year and a half on this education before I chose to
          jump off. During the time I spent here, I learned a lot
          sustainability, which has developed into a great interest for me. I
          still have the entrepreneurship courses with me and give me a lot of
          inspiration in my career. I dropped out because I noticed that I was
          on the wrong side of the sector, I want to be involved in creating and
          therefore I applied for Digital Designer at Yrgo.
