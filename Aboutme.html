        <h3>Get to know me!</h3>
        <p class="para">
          I'm a happy bubbly girl with great work ethics and huge source of
          energy. I like being able to be creative and create both physical and
          digital products. I have an interest in cars and interior home design.
          I have previously studied what I thought was going to be sustainable
          management but turned out to be more economics which made me drop off.
          The classes with sustainability really planted a seed in me and is now
          something I am very passionate about and also partly educated. I take
          this knowledge with me everywhere I go, in my personal life as well as
          professional.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          I ended up at Yrgo studying Digital Design because my sister who is
          surface designer at Lynk & Co hooked me up with the school. Since then
          its been a blast! So excited for you to see my work so far, don't
          hesitate to contact me if you're interested or if you would like to
          discuss work opportunities.
